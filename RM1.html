               </div>
		<div>
                <p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Life is a gift of God, God has gifted us with his own life for he created us in his own image with potential to be like him. Growth is a life long process for all. The real sense of life and growth is this God given potential to put it into action. God has given to us human beings, one more important gift. It is more important than life itself in one sense: </br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“FREE WILL” – FREEDOM.</br></br>
This God given gift, not even God will touch it, human being is free to use this gift in order to become what we are created to be:</br></br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; CHIDREN OF GOD.</br></br>
In this process of growth, in the early stages of life we need hep from others especially parents, for example when we plant a seed of any tree normally it grow upward, when we see the tree is leaning to one side we try to give a support, in order to help it grow straight. If we leave it unattended it will become difficult, at times it will become impossible to make it straight.</br></br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When we have a blue print for our growth : GOD HIMSELF, because we are created in his own image. In order to grow as a true human being created in God’s image, we need to know God himself. The more we come to know God, the more we come to know ourself. For this reason we need to take care of life and growth from early childhood to the day of our death. We need to keep learning, who is God and whom I am. Since God has given us everything we need for our growth in potency, our life time is meant to transform what is in potency to action.<br/><br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Human life is beautiful, but it is also trying and tiring. It is a battle between flesh and spirit. We are not slaves to sin. We live in the spirit, spirit lives in me, in us, this is the spiritual life we live in the spirit. God has given us the power to win the battle. We only need to follow the inner voice God has put in us, to follow the truth and love. When we follow the truth and love, the evil one speaks in our heart too, we need silence to recognise the voice of God and voice of the evil one. We need to have the courage to choose the truth and love and not the voice of the evil one which is destruction. It is a challenge; it is difficult to follow but Lord has given us the power to follow it, that is why we need silence to listen within. Today’s world is much noisy. Television, internet, mobile phones keeps us very busy, but we need to find time for silence, because our life is very precious, it is a preparation to live for ever in glory. In order to reach this glorious life after our life on earth, suffering is necessary reality, it is the nature of our fallen condition. <br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Believe in God and love for God and one another. Hold our both hands and takes it up to reach that hope - eternal life. Our life is constantly awaiting to reach the other world after our death. But while here on earth we need to live a good life, so don’t stop walking. Walking with small step, running we may get tired and stop, but if we walk in small steps speak of spiritual life. Of course on earth we walk fast, but in our spiritual life, in silence with time we take small steps so that we may not miss the way, we may not fall. In hope, in prayer we make this journey. In hope we are saint. Prayer is an exercise of hope. In personal prayer, leave space to God to speak to us, He is our loving father who always wish to speak to us always. He waits for us that we listen to him. He also enjoys our talking. He listens to every work we speak to him with great Joy and great Love.<br/><br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This beautiful universe God created for us to be our home. At times we have the feeling that there is too much darkness. But God’s love and light enters even in this dark world. It is we who speak and act without God, but even God gives us the grace in order to speak when we speak against him. The moment he takes breath from us we are not existing. But he, in his love allows us to act in our freedom, hoping that we will act in love. But very often through our acts, we act against that love which brings darkness into the world. Each one of us need to try hard to light a little light in that darkness, so that the darkness may not at once transform all powers into the darkness, this is our mission, this is the purpose of our life, each one of us has this purpose to light the world around us. Also, our difficulties and sufferings have a part to play. Offering every difficulty with love, for love of God and souls brings great miracles in the world. It is important that we offer everything to God because God has a purpose for each one of us. But every single word, even our breath we can offer for love of God, and for love of souls, the humanity, present, past, future. All the generations we are connected to each other, our action can reach the past generation, the present entire humanity on earth and the future generations to come. So, everything in God has a meaning, for this offering is very important.<br/><br/>

Education and formation is not the same, though education is included in formation. <br/><br/>
Self knowledge – the best way to know myself is to know others in love. By looking at myself I will not know myself, but looking at others in love I will know who I am.<br/><br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Victim – a living being offered a scarifies to God. Scarifies implies that the victim is actually or equivalently given up as an act of adoration, for the expiation to the divine mercy’s grace . The destruction of the victim is its immolation. The voluntary surrender of the victim is the offering or oblation, together they constitute the sacrifice. Now remember we are taking about our self love, this victim we are talking about our selfishness. We are not talking about a human being is killed as a scarifies, but we are denying ourselves, surrendering our will. Killing a human being is not a scarifies, it is a sin, but when I offer my will, I surrender my will to God to do what is right which God has planned for me, when I do that act it is a scarifies.

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Silence is not avoidance of the world, a tendency to isolate oneself, or being inactive. Rather, in silence one becomes vigilant and active, to listen to God and to oneself, to meet the true self and oneself. For God alone my soul waits in silence, from him comes my salvation. Silence creates the space for listening to God, it provides time to explore our relationship to Souls. The practice of being in this silence nurtures our capacity to listen to others. Reflection gives us access to listening for our inner voice. Presence is the awareness of listening to another of connecting at the heart level, the practice of taking a mundane ordinary activity and giving it full attention.</br></br>
Life on earth is the crucible in which grace is transformed into love in which we are carried to heaven and live for all eternity in glory.</br></br>
“The key to a treasure is not the treasure, but if we give away the key we also handover the treasure. The cross is an exceptionally precious key, the cross is an astonishing mystery”:: Power of Silence</br></br>
What is evil actually? Today the danger lies in the unbridled activism of the modern world. We are always called to fight, to comb the countryside, to overthrow our adversaries and to destroy them. Indeed, man is driven to compound one evil with another, whereas he ought to let the weed grow with the wheat. Silence will give us the patience to wait for the moment when the useless plants will fall by themselves. Thanks to silence, we will know how to bridle our time and wait for God’s hour with perseverance, so I have to forge an alliance with him and walk under his guidance:  God or Nothing

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We advanced the truth by experience of terror. We succeed through failures. We know not how to write except by having done wrong. we know what is right not positively but negatively. we do not see the truth at once and make towards it, but we fall upon and try and try era and find it is not the truth. we group about by touch not by sight and saw by miserable experience exhaust the   possible modes of acting till not is left, but truth remaining. Such is the process by which we succeed. We walk to heaven backwards - : John Henry Newman

		<div>
                <p>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is where we should try to grow, to live, to love in true friendship with God. God walked with Adam in the cool of the evening. Moses spoke with God as a friend. God knew them in their weaknesses and strength and grow in friendship with God .Can we live in love with our family members, our brothers and sisters in the world at large. When I live in friendship with God and in his love everyone else, there is not much problem even if others find it as a problem. Since I have reached the source of my love who is God himself and it is no more my love for God is not my concern but his love for me through me for others is my concern. <br/><br/>
To keep the laws and rules may be of our family, community, country there should be right intension for love of God and for my neighbour.<br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To have relationship with God means is to have only one thought, one desire in our mind and in our heart: God. All our actions are directed by one desire, to do God’s will. In the beginning, when we tried to pray always even if not allowed but pronouncing the word by moving lips, and when  hands are free by using the beads not necessarily counting but using it to move from one prayer to the next. Later, when you pray constantly you will find that your heart is praying constantly and conversing with God like someone who is physically present to you. These are not new verse but eternal truth for all may be of any religion but worshiping one true living God. Freedom of spirit by which we live our life with true love, without reducing life into keeping rules and laws ,but living in love with God and with our brothers and sisters  while on earth.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Reflection from memories: I grew up in a family where I enjoyed my childhood. Today after seeing the children in different part of the world, I do not stop thanking God for having such a beautiful childhood years. Growing up with siblings, school going years where children of the neighbourhood together going to the closest school where we first mostly begin to open our heart from our little world of father and mother to a wider world, oh how educative was that experience. Today when we look back which today’s children miss a lot. Now a days parents carry their children to school, so there is no chance of meeting other children walking together in order to go to school to widen their little world. Years later going to higher studies but not choosing to stay in a hostel, but as a day scholar why did do this. Since was planning to become a religious and for that matter a radical one, wanted to spend maximum time with parents and also to know to the world it was planning to give up. I can not give up something which I do not know, so as not to regret later on and long for it when came to know, I am so grateful to the God for leading me to this clear vision. And I know next generation did not have life like this we had and things get from bad to worse. How I wish to work to help them to bring back to that life once again where children enjoyed their childhood years.

               </div>
		<div>
                <p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A lifelong commitment unto eternity and death is a doorway to eternity. When we choose a committed life, we may shed few tears in the beginning when we think our parents and family and what we left behind. Later on in the new surroundings, we see the real-life situations - family life, true concerns, love and care for each other. It did not look so sugary, but real. We live a normal life, we do not see much difference from what we were living before, but we come to know more and more as the years pass by and then when we look back to those years we see how God was leading us slowly and gently into the life he had planned for us from all eternity for our happiness a life long commitment. At times when we leave our native land, we may feel a bit lost but as we begin to get involved in life activities we do not forget our family and native land but we keep them always in our prayers, our dear and near ones. As the new place becomes part of our life, together we make one family, the near and the far. Life continues with its ups and downs, we live as we see, as we should do we should think. While we live, we may not see all the mistakes but later on when we look back we can see at times we were wrong. But through it all we were growing , we are living fully , later on we do not regret but we thank God because if we wait to learn everything and to begin to live we will miss much the good part of our life with out living, then how do we make up for what we do where we mistakes it remains as a life experience for the future and we thank God for the missed chances in which we took our wrong doings to grow for the future. As the years pass by we begin to see and understand deeper and higher reality as God created every single human being uniquely loved by God and live in friendship with God: to become Holy.<br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lifelong commitment – once make a choice hold on to it to the end. Difficulties are sure to come, but those are not eternal but passing, as the clouds cover the sun, clouds will disappear and the sun will be visible so hold on to the end, only God is eternal. Once come to existence even for a second that a human being lives for all eternity.

Silence means making place for truth, prayer is letting the truth transform us, this truth is love, this love can take us beyond. <br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is only in heaven that I shall have the whole story of my life that I shall see God, all of him, and in him the things that he has made in the degree in which my heart has welcomed God on earth. My mind shall penetrate the fathomless depth of God himself in heaven, never exhausting the divine riches for we are not God, but seeing God as he sees himself, for here indeed we are like God and one with him in an eternal union  - My way of life –<br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;God’s beauty, which is reflected in creation but can be destroyed by man, can always be reborn, thanks to forgiveness. If man rejects forgiveness, he detaches himself from God and falls into a subhuman life dominated by ugliness, lying and evil. If he accepts forgiveness, good is reborn – God or Nothing-<br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Man is not happy when he accumulates material goods; he flourishes if he confirms his whole life to God given natural law within his heart. Wealth can lead to solitude and sadness whereas God always give joy. Progress without God is a false happiness. <br/><br/>

The deeper our faith, the stronger our hope, the greater our desire the larger will be our capacity to receive that gift which is very great indeed. No I have seen it, it has no color, no ear has heard it, it has no sound. It has not entered man’s heart; man’s heart must enter into it – Augustine to Proba – <br/><br/>
Only on my arrival in heaven I become fully human – Ignatius – <br/><br/>
Today as I prepare the breakfast for my dear one I have this beautiful sight of sun, the disc turning silver and black alternatively and very fine thin rays flowing from sun penetrating me. Oh god of beauty how much more beautiful you must be, the author of such a beauty and how your love penetrates my whole being.<br/><br/>
Offer yourself to me to be loved and transformed, and to be used as an instrument of love and of healing for all<br/><br/>
When you give your money, you give nothing. When you give your time, you give something. when you give your heart, you give everything.<br/><br/>
As God I am love and source of all love and the life of most holy trinity in a circulation of living love that is perfect<br/><br/>


“In his passion God taught us how to forgive out of love, how to forget out of humility” – Conscience: Conscience is a measured measure. <br/><br/>
Conscience is a human faculty in the intellect. Conscience is precisely measured against a standard, not created but preexisting measure, God.<br/><br/>
First principle of the natural moral law is that all things have a nature and a purpose, example a tomato plant has the potency to give tomatoes, human being also have a nature and a purpose - to know and love God. Second principle is nature is good. Third principle is to allow to grow in the nature, do not put obstacles to the growth, provide an acceptable atmosphere. No one is ignorant of the principles of the moral law – ccc 1860.<br/><br/>
God is the order of nature, to live according to the natural moral law is to live according to the will of God. Natural moral law is immutable(unchangeable). – ccc 1957<br/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Natural moral law is for whole humanity. Jews and Christians call it 10 commandments, but it is a law for whole human race. Original sin is rejection of reality, want to become God without God, not possible. What was the rejected reality, I am a created being capable of making choices in the light of God’s law and my God given ‘Freedom’. Though God given, God does not impede our freedom. God’s law protects and promotes human freedom. God made us in his own image, in order to become his likeness, he kept the ‘catalog’, ’simple’ inside us. The catalog is natural moral law which Jews and Christians call it 10 commandments. Follow the catalog to become what we are made to be.<br/><br/>

Inspite of all our weakness, God is in love with us and keeps on using each one of us to light his light of love and compassion in the world. <br/><br/>
We certainly do not feel like rocks, but only like small stones. However, no small stone is useless: indeed, in God’s hands the smallest stone become precious because he picks it up, gazes at it with great tenderness, fashions it with his spirit and positions it in the right place that he had always had in mind where it can be more useful to the whole structure. Each of us is a small stone, but in God’s hand participates in the building of the world, and all of us, as small as we are, are rented “ Living stone” because when God takes stone in his hand he makes it his own, he infuses it with life, full of life, full of life from holy one, full of life from his love and thus  we have a place and a mission in the world – Pop Francis -.

Four types of happiness:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Filex – happiness to the senses, It only satisfies me only when I have it. It has an illusion to satisfy not in reality, example good sleep<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Lactus – It is a happiness which comes to us through intellectual natural gifts, bringing joys. Example when I give myself to solve a mathematic problem<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Theology of friendship – I am known for who I am and accepted as a gift, even when I don’t, and wish my good. Friendship last even when we are far from each other. Why? We live outside of ourselves in God. True friendship is diffusive. False friendship is based on preference.<br/> 
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;The attitude or happiness – Christ is our friend; all friendship tends to be attitude. <br/><br/>

Principles:</br>
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;The first philosophical principle – what is the last in the order of the execution is first in the order of intension.<br/> 
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Second principle – I am transformed by what I do. <br/> 
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Third principle – man always acts for an end (for happiness)<br/> 
&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;Fourth principle - choices transforms us.<br/> <br/>

Silence is no virtue when charity demands speech.<br/> <br/>

Do not try to understand in order to believe. But believe in order to understand. – Augustine – <br/> <br/>

Human mind without faith is blind to many truths, to many things, and even to many people.<br/> <br/>

The rose stands for charity and the thrones for vigilance… Grapes represent love and their leaves gentleness …  Wheat signifies confidence and hope …  Violet stands for true humility.<br/> <br/>

Since the first Christmas God sees all of us human race each one of us in his son Jesus.<br/> <br/>

Temptation is a blessing for you. It is the water that washes and makes us clean. But we need to pray not to fall into temptation because in temptation we show our strength to resist what is evil. <br/> <br/>

Love is fundamental and innate vocation of every human being.<br/> <br/>

You want something to remember me by all I can leave you is an invitation to become holy.<br/> <br/>

The contemplation of the sacred humanity is the surest way of arriving at the true knowledge of God. <br/> <br/>

God is hidden in the heart of man. He is hidden there with the mysteries of his passion. God has suffered and man must suffer, whether he wishes it or not. If he suffers through love, in union with God, he will suffer less and will gain merit. - Mariam the little Arab –<br/> <br/>

What is grace on earth is glory in heaven.<br/> <br/>

The difference between the two (dreams and ecstasies) means the difference between two is perceptible. The dream is an impoverishment of the psychic life; the ecstasy brings enrichment. The dream looks back on the past; the ecstasy is oriented towards the future which it fertile.  The dreamer wakens from his sleep and sees his projects comes to nothing, while the ecstasy returns to normal state with a more lucid mind, a determined will, and a moral standard that continues to mount higher. The ecstatic is strengthened for greater work. <br/> <br/>

Even if the ocean is in front of me, I will use only what I need and not all that I want <br/> <br/>

When you see a person and recognise that person as my brother or sister, the night is over, the day has begun. There is light and no more darkness in me.<br/> <br/>

Eternity in three words – life, love, and communion. Eternity is a great wheeling motion, exaltation for ever, plunging into the life of God, into the love of God and into God’s trinitarian communion. <br/> <br/>

Eternity is the present moment. Eternity is the palm of your hand. Eternity is a sowing with fire which suddenly take rot and breaks down the barriers that prevent our heart from being a deep abyss.<br/> <br/>

Eternity is you, Lord, and we find you in love and in communion; You in me and I in you and you in them and them with me for all eternity. – God or Nothing-<br/> <br/>

Icon is a window by which we see into the mystery. <br/> <br/>

Holy picture is a piece of art used for devotion. Picture is a piece of art. <br/> <br/>

God is a silent lover and a lighthouse so bright that it remains invisible. Genuine love does not speak. Are not wordless smile the most beautiful? God’s silence is a voice, the most profound of all .- God or Nothing –<br/> <br/>

All creations speaks of God. Thank to its marvelous silence – God or Nothing – <br/> <br/>

The joy and excitement of theological knowledge is the like the joy and excitement of any other love. Truth is food and truth is light. Not on bread alone does man lives, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. So revealed truth is food. Food nourishes only those who eat it. We are not nourished by the food that someone else have eaten, to be nourished by food I must eat food by myself.  Truth is light, not to see the truth is to be in darkness, to see the truth wrong is to be in double darkness. The greater part of reality can be known only if God tells us. Doctrine is what God tells; lack of doctrine I lack light. To be stumbling along in the light that my guide can see is not the same as I walk in the light I see.<br/> <br/>

Our life of faith must often warm in the night, the more faith has to confront trails, the stronger it becomes. Nights of faith always end with finding the little light of God – God or Nothing –<br/> <br/>
In the human heart one that knows God or one that is still searching for God, there is already the luminous presence of God – God or Nothing –<br/> <br/>
Love produces desire and desire, when it is excessive, is called thirst. – St. Robert Bellarmine<br/> <br/>
Sin is the abandonment of God by man; it is the creature for faking the creator…. Sin is a separation, a divorce – the original divorce from unity with God when all other divorces are derived. <br/> <br/>
Man as a creature is marked by ontological selfishness. And infant who is born has consciousness only of itself. Initially the child perceives its mother as an extension of its own person. We all started by being solipsist! gradually through frustration, baby ends up understanding that its mother is another person. Several stages and some years later the child will arrive at a love that is at first prompted by self interest, but finally gratuitous. In a parallel way in the spiritual life, we must travel and invent distance. It is necessary to go from total selfishness to sacrificial love that is no longer focused at all on self, in the image of God’s own great love. This is the progress of smallest creature towards the infinity of heaven… Such an evolution would normally take an extremely long time. – The power of silence - <br/> <br/>

When the hour of grace strikes, it always finds secret entrances to reach the soul that God calls. <br/> <br/>
We especially those of us who apply ourselves to theology must study in such a way that love corresponds to the knowledge and in the manner of Cardinal de Bérulle, who as soon as he had discovered some truth would give himself over to prayer either to obtain something or to enter into certain feeling or to produce from it some deed. And in this way he acquired so great sanctity and knowledge that one can hardly find their like…  The ideal way of studying theology, he himself also wanted to reconcile knowledge and sanctity. To achieve this, he would attach himself to a newly conceived truth only to let it enter the depths of his soul, he would then put it into practice and draw from it all its useful consequences. Actually, he could not have made a discovery more important than that. <br/> <br/>
Wherever weariness and pain we may experience in living the commandments of love and following the way of justice, the cross remains the source of our growth and sanctification. Prayer is most precious for it and nourishes a daily commitment to love. <br/> <br/>
We are to be the stewards of God’s mysteries, a witness to the invisible in the world, for we are stewards of invisible and priceless treasures belonging to the spiritual and supernatural order. <br/> <br/>


The one thing necessary:<br/>
As everyone can easily understand the interior life is an elevated form of intimate conversation, which  everyone has within himself as soon as he or she is alone, even in the tumult of a great city. From the moment one seize to converse  with his fellow being, man converses interiorly with himself or herself about what preoccupies him or her most. As soon as a man seriously seek truth and goodness, this intimate conversation with himself or herself tends to become conversation with God. Little by little, instead on seeking himself in everything , instead of tending more or less consciously to make himself or herself a center, man tends to seek God in everything and to substitute for egoism, love of God and of souls for him. This constitutes the interior life. <br/> <br/>
To wish to get along with God, the first cause and last end leads to an abyss; not only to nothingness but also to physical and moral wretchedness that is worse than nothingness.<br/> <br/> 
When man will no longer fulfill his great religious duties to God who created him and who is his last end, he makes a religion for himself, since he absolutely can not keep along without religion.<br/> <br/>
Knowledge of dogma and dogmatic expressions and formula can progress, but dogma remains always immutable in itself.<br/> <br/>
People can grow 20 years in 20 days when that has focussed their attention on what is really important, and they have accepted God’s will that they soon depart from this life. At a time of great stress, the familiar symbols of faith and devotion will take on new importance and become intensely meaningful. A dying person with faith will derive strength from reciting the rosary or praying before a particular picture or reading passages from the psalms new testament. <br/> <br/>
Knowledge puffs up but love builds up.<br/> <br/>
Good speech is silver, but silence is pure gold.<br/> <br/>

From the divine heart three streams flow endlessly, the first is the stream of mercy for sinners, it pours into their heart, sentiments of contrition and repentance. The second is the stream of charity which helps all in need and especially aids those seeking perfection to find the means of surmounting their difficulty. From the third stream flows love and light for the benefit of his friends who had attained perfection, these he wishes to unite to himself so that they may share his knowledge and commandment and in their individual ways devote themselves wholly to advancing his glory – Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque<br/> <br/>
In the evening of this life, I shall appear before you with empty hands, for I do not ask you, Lord, to count my works. All our justice is stained in your eyes. – St. Therese of Lisieux <br/> <br/>
The only credible form of authority is born of sitting at the feet of others in order to serve God. And that only time one can look down at others is when we are helping them to stand up – Pope Fransis<br/> <br/>
Kingdom of truth end of life, kingdom of holiness end of grace, kingdom of justice, love and peace <br/> <br/>
Discernment is not about discovering what moral we can kept out from this life, but about recognizing how we can better accomplish the mission entrusted to us at our baptism at our birth. This entails readiness to make scarifies even to sacrificing everything, for happiness is a paradox. The experience it most when we accept the mysterious logic that is not of this world. This is our logic, the cross. Once we enter into these dynamics, we will not let our consciousness be numbed and we will open ourself generously to discernment.<br/> <br/>
If we do not behave as we believe, we end up by believing the way we behave. – Fulton Sheen – <br/> <br/>
Purgatory is a punishment which presupposes a sin, that could have been avoided and an insufficient satisfaction that could have been completed if we had accepted with better disposition the suffering of the present life. It is certain in fact that no one will be retained in purgatory except for sin he or she could have avoided or for negligence in making reparation for them. Normally purgatory should be spend in this life, while meriting while growing enough, instead of after death with out merit
