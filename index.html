&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Life is a gift of God, God has gifted us with his own life for he created us in his own image with potential to be like him. Growth is a life long process for all. The real sense of life and growth is this God given potential to put it into action. God has given to us human beings, one more important gift. It is more important than life itself in one sense: </br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“FREE WILL” – FREEDOM.</br></br>
This God given gift, not even God will touch it, human being is free to use this gift in order to become what we are created to be:</br></br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; CHIDREN OF GOD.</br></br>
In this process of growth, in the early stages of life we need hep from others especially parents, for example when we plant a seed of any tree normally it grow upward, when we see the tree is leaning to one side we try to give a support, in order to help it grow straight. If we leave it unattended it will become difficult, at times it will become impossible to make it straight.</br></br>
When we have a blue print for our growth : GOD HIMSELF, because we are created in his own image. In order to grow as a true human being created in God’s image, we need to know God himself. The more we come to know God, the more we come to know ourself. For this reason we need to take care of life and growth from early childhood to the day of our death. We need to keep learning, who is God and whom I am. Since God has given us everything we need for our growth in potency, our life time is meant to transform what is in potency to action.

	       <p class="fs-5 fw-medium fst-italic text-primary">Silence</p>

                <p>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Silence is not avoidance of the world, a tendency to isolate oneself, or being inactive. Rather, in silence one becomes vigilant and active, to listen to God and to oneself, to meet the true self and oneself. For God alone my soul waits in silence, from him comes my salvation. Silence creates the space for listening to God, it provides time to explore our relationship to Souls. The practice of being in this silence nurtures our capacity to listen to others. Reflection gives us access to listening for our inner voice. Presence is the awareness of listening to another of connecting at the heart level, the practice of taking a mundane ordinary activity and giving it full attention.</br></br>
Life on earth is the crucible in which grace is transformed into love in which we are carried to heaven and live for all eternity in glory.</br></br>
“The key to a treasure is not the treasure, but if we give away the key we also handover the treasure. The cross is an exceptionally precious key, the cross is an astonishing mystery”:: Power of Silence</br></br>
What is evil actually? Today the danger lies in the unbridled activism of the modern world. We are always called to fight, to comb the countryside, to overthrow our adversaries and to destroy them. Indeed, man is driven to compound one evil with another, whereas he ought to let the weed grow with the wheat. Silence will give us the patience to wait for the moment when the useless plants will fall by themselves. Thanks to silence, we will know how to bridle our time and wait for God’s hour with perseverance, so I have to forge an alliance with him and walk under his guidance:  God or Nothing
